Here’s a **mock interview script** simulating an Amazon technical interview, covering coding, system design, and behavioral rounds with detailed feedback:

### **🎯 Mock Interview: Amazon Technical Interview Simulation**

#### **Interviewer (I):** "Welcome! Let’s start with a coding problem. You have 30 minutes."
**Problem:** [Merge Intervals](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-intervals/)  
**Candidate (C):**  
1. **Clarifies Requirements:**  
   - "Are intervals sorted? Can they be empty?" *(I: "No, handle unsorted. Empty input returns empty.")*  
2. **Approach:**  
   - "I’ll sort intervals by start time, then merge overlapping ones in one pass."  
3. **Solution Code:**  
   ```python
   def merge(intervals):
       intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])
       merged = []
       for interval in intervals:
           if not merged or merged[-1][1] < interval[0]:
               merged.append(interval)
           else:
               merged[-1][1] = max(merged[-1][1], interval[1])
       return merged
   ```
4. **Testing:**  
   - Tests `[[1,3],[2,6],[8,10]]` → `[[1,6],[8,10]]` (overlap).  
   - Edge case: `[]` → `[]`.  

**Feedback:**  
✅ **Good:** Clear explanation, optimal solution (O(n log n)).  
⚠️ **Improve:** Mention space complexity (O(n) for sorting in Python).

#### **I:** "Now, let’s design Amazon’s product recommendation system."  
**C’s Approach:**  
1. **Requirements Clarification:**  
   - "Is this for ‘Frequently Bought Together’ or personalized recommendations?" *(I: "Personalized.")*  
2. **High-Level Design:**  
   - **Data Pipeline:** Clickstream data → Kafka → Spark (aggregation).  
   - **ML Model:** Collaborative filtering (user-item matrix) + Matrix Factorization.  
   - **Storage:** Redis for real-time recommendations, DynamoDB for user profiles.  
3. **Scalability:**  
   - "Use sharding for DynamoDB. Cache hot recommendations with CDN."  

**Feedback:**  
✅ **Good:** Mentions AWS services (DynamoDB, Kafka).  
⚠️ **Improve:** Discuss cold-start problem and fallback (e.g., popular items).

#### **I:** "Tell me about a time you faced a tight deadline."  
**C’s Response (STAR Format):**  
- **Situation:** "Our team had 2 days to fix a checkout bug before Prime Day."  
- **Task:** "I led debugging for the payment timeout issue."  
- **Action:** "Traced logs to a race condition, wrote a hotfix, and coordinated QA."  
- **Result:** "Deployed fix in 18 hours, zero downtime during Prime Day."  
- **Principle:** "Bias for Action + Customer Obsession."  

**Feedback:**  
✅ **Good:** Quantifiable result, ties to Amazon principles.  
⚠️ **Improve:** Add how you mitigated risks (e.g., rollback plan).

### **📝 Key Takeaways for Amazon Interviews**
1. **Coding Round:**  
   - Always **clarify inputs/edge cases** first.  
   - **Verbally explain** while coding (Amazon values communication).  

2. **System Design:**  
   - **Draw boxes/lines** for components (e.g., "Here’s my Kafka queue").  
   - **Discuss trade-offs** (e.g., "Redis gives low latency but costs more").  

3. **Behavioral Round:**  
   - **Use STAR** but keep it concise (<2 mins).  
   - **Link to Leadership Principles** explicitly.
