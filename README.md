## Follow-up Questions
**User**:  
yes

**Assistant**:  
Great! Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide to **getting started with LeetCode effectively**, whether you're a beginner or looking to sharpen your skills for interviews.  

---

### **1. Set a Clear Goal**  
- **For Interviews?** Focus on **Blind 75** (a curated list of must-solve problems) or **Grind 75** (an updated version).  
- **For Competitions?** Practice speed and advanced algorithms (DP, graphs, etc.).  
- **For Learning?** Start with topic-wise study (e.g., arrays â†’ linked lists â†’ trees).  

---

### **2. Learn the Basics First**  
Before diving into problems, ensure you understand:  
âœ… **Data Structures**: Arrays, HashMaps, Linked Lists, Stacks/Queues, Trees, Graphs.  
âœ… **Algorithms**: Binary Search, Sorting, Recursion, BFS/DFS, Dynamic Programming.  
âœ… **Time & Space Complexity** (Big-O notation).  

ðŸ“Œ **Resources**:  
- **Free**: [NeetCode.io](https://neetcode.io/) (video explanations), GeeksforGeeks.  
- **Paid**: *"Grokking the Coding Interview"* (Educative), *"Algorithms Part 1/2"* (Coursera).  

---

### **3. Follow a Structured Plan**  
#### **Beginners:**  
1. **Start with "Top Interview Questions (Easy)"** â†’ build confidence.  
2. **Move to "Blind 75"** ([LeetCode Blind 75 List](https://www.teamblind.com/post/New-Year-Gift---Curated-List-of-Top-75-LeetCode-Questions-to-Save-Your-Time-OaM1orEU)).  
3. **Do topic-wise practice** (e.g., 10 array problems â†’ 10 string problems).  

#### **Intermediate/Advanced:**
